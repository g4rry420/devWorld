                    offered to look after your dog. Your high school math teacher was impressed. He once said 
                    you wouldnâ€™t amount to anything.You sure showed him. But now here you are, fifty feet from 
                    your spaceship with no way to get back. Your dog will be so sad. Your math teacher will be so 
                    smug. Pretty devastating.</p>
